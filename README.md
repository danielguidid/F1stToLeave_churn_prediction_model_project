# F1stToLeave â€“ Churn Prediction Model Project

This project addresses a **customer churn classification problem** using an end-to-end supervised machine learning pipeline. The process includes:

- Comprehensive **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numericals)
- **Class balancing** to address target imbalance
- **Model comparison** across multiple algorithms
- **Hyperparameter tuning** to optimize performance
- **Feature importance analysis** for interpretability

The primary objective is to build a robust model that accurately predicts which customers are at risk of churning, with a strong focus on optimizing the **F1 Score** â€” a metric that balances precision and recall, especially important in imbalanced classification tasks.

## File Language Notice

- The **notebook (`.ipynb`)** and the **project brief (`instructions.pdf`)** are written in **Spanish**, as this project was originally developed for a Spanish-language context.
- All code is fully annotated and structured for easy understanding, regardless of language.
